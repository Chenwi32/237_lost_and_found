        How the platform works

      <Text>
        On 237L&F there are just two things; either you found a lost document
        (which for now our main focus is ID cards) or you are searching for a
        lost document, that's it. <br />
        If you found a lost document, you should go to the{" "}
        <Link color="brand.100" href={`/nationalIdCollection`}>
          Found an ID card
        </Link>{" "}
        section and fill out the form to submit the details required to help the
        owner of the ID card recover it.

      <Stack
        margin={"auto"}
        mt={10}
        mb={10}
        boxShadow="lg"
        p={5}
        align={"center"}
        borderRadius="lg"
        maxW={550}
        gap={5}
        direction="column"
      >
        <Text color={"brand.400"}>See available Documents.</Text>

        <Link href="/feeds">
          <Button
            bg="brand.100"
            color="brand.400"
            _hover={{
              bg: "brand.200",
            }}
            p={5}
          >
            Available Documents
          </Button>
        </Link>
      </Stack>

        If you lost an ID card, then you should go to the{" "}
        <Link color="brand.100" href={`/nationalId`}>
          Lost an ID card
        </Link>{' '}
        section. <br />
        Since this platform is still very new, we haven't gotten too many lost
        ID card with us yet, so chances are that you might not be able to find
        your document here; nevertheless, just come back from time to time to
        check, and then spread the word to get more people to know about the
        platform, because the more people know about it, the higher the chance
        that someone who finds your ID card might bring it here. <br />
        To direct someone to the platform, just copy and share this link:
        <Text as={"span"} color={"brand.100"}>
          
          " https://lost-and-found-8ef8a.web.app/ "
        </Text>
        with them for now, we are still working to make the sharing process
        easy. Thank you very much!!

        Let's work together to address this lost ID cards problem!! <br />

        platforms convenient for you{" "}

        This platform is developed to help people recover their lost document,
        not to track down theives who stole their belongings, someone who stole
        your belonging would not cary your documents to come and give back to
        you – only a fool will do that – so bare in mind that people who bring
        documents to this platform are kind hearted people who want to help.{" "}
        <br />
        <strong>NB:</strong> If you come here and find your document and then
        instead of appreciating, you start causing triouble, you will scare away
        people who genuinely want to help and mind you, there will be
        consequences that will follow your actions, because we have a strong
        legal backing, so be ready to assume them. Nevertheless, if ever you
        notice something fishy, don't hesitate to{" "}
        <Link href={"/contact"}>contact us</Link> and we'll sort it out the
        right way. Thank you!!
