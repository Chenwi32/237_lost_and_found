          message={`This platform is still under construction, so lots of it's features are
          still not functional yet, but we promise you the best in future.`}

        <h2 className="title">How the platform works</h2>

        <p>
          On 237L&F there are just two things; either you found a lost document
          or you are searching for a lost document, that's it. <br />
          If you found a lost document, you should go to the{" "}
          <Link href={`/found`}>Found a document</Link> section and follow the
          steps to submit the details required to help the owner of the
          document(s) to recover them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="nb">NB:</span> This feature is not functional as of
          14<sup>th</sup> July 2022, when it will be fully functional, you won't
          see this again.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you lost a document, then you should go to the{" "}
          <Link href={`/search`}>Lost a document</Link> section. Not all the
          features in this section are functional. <br />
          While waiting for the full version, you can take advantage of the
          features that are available now.
          <Link href={`/nationalId`}>
            <span className="nb">The National ID Card</span>
          </Link>{" "}
          search feature is available now and the others will be incrementally
          added.
          <br />
          Since this platform is still very new, we haven't gotten too many lost
          documents with us yet, so chances are that you might not be able to
          find your document here, but nevertheless, just come back from time to
          time to check.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might feel like Yelling at us now for bringing something that is
          not fully functional to you, but please before you go to that end,
          please hear us out.
          <br />
          The reason why we are doing this is that we want to know your reaction
          to the project, because in the end, it is about what people need not
          what we think is best, so please send us your thoughts on the project
          and it will help us see how we can best design the project to address
          the need, because without a question, this issue of lost document is a
          problem that needs to be addressed. <br />
          Leave us a message through any of the platform convenient for{" "}
          <Link href={`/contact`}>
            <a>here &#8594;</a>
          </Link>
        </p>

        <hr />
      </div>
    </>
